Freely available materials and insights on Python 3

python_crash_course_20210510.ipynb contains a detailed tutorial on several basic concepts on the Python language. It's still a work in progress but I hope it will be useful! Special acknowledgements to Jay Lacroix (LearnLinuxTV), Tony Staunton (Skillshare), and the University of Michigan for providing insights, inspiration, and ideas to create this.

20210510_course1_week1_libraries_data.ipynb contains some tips on using the pandas library. These are notes I took from a Coursera specialization. It depends on the cartwheel dataset, from the University of Michigan (cartwheeldata.csv). I will eventually merge it into the python crash course notebook, likely with a different dataset

bdiethelmv_week4project_02082021.ipynb contains a data science project I created as the final assignment for a Coursera course. The relevant datasets are the files:
religioncensus_county_2000.csv and religioncensus_county_2010.csv
